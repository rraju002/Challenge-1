## Description:

In creating our first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, we will combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. Luxurious Watches is an ecommerce site where you can look through and find admirable watches from our entire collection that we have provided. With that you can then add a watch to your cart and create a purchase.
